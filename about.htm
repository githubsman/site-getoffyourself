	This web site has been a chance to try out all kinds of things.


	</p>

	<ul class="square">
	<li> A bright punchy style that intends to deliver just a few points.  This was inspired by <a href="http://www.danpink.com/books/johnny-bunko" target="_blank">Johnny Bunko</a>,  which summarizes six principles in a manga comic.
	</li>

	<li> HSLA color specification.
	</li>

	<li> CSS3 round borders.
	</li>

	<li> Embedded fonts.  Thank you, <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com" target="_blank">Font Squirrel</a>.
	</li>

	<li> A responsive CSS framework that uses media queries to provide formatting for any browser.  Thank you, Dave Gamache, for <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a>.
	</li>


	<li> &quot;Touch-friendly&quot; navigation that doesn't use old-school links (good for tiny screens).
	</li>

	<li> <a href="http://http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> for hover effects, content-loading and in-page navigation.
	</li>

	<li> My dog photos from two weeks ago.  There is only one photo but I should be able to place a half-dozen more.
	</li>

	<li> All the things I <a href="http://bebroken.com" target="_blank">learned</a> this decade.  Still under construction... I mean, I am; and the pages are too.
	</li>

	<h4>Stuff you read here</h4>
	<p>The <a href="what_you_think.htm">statement</a> from Martin Luther was written in 1544 and translated into English
	centuries later, so I have paraphrased the
	<a href="http://www.lutherantheology.com/uploads/works/walther/LG/lecture-12.html" target="_blank">
	usual version</a> without hesitation or guilty feelings.</p>
