            All I'm asking is join our group and hang out with us, the honest-to-God, hard-boiled sinners.

            Don't let Christ seem weak and insignificant. Don't call him "savior" only when you are apologizing for small sins, childish sins, sins that no one thinks are important. No, no! That doesn't work at all! Christ has to save you from genuine, heinous, damnable crimes, from the most shocking sins you can imagine. Let's be real. He has to save you from all sins put together, a vast totality.

            Once I was suffering like you are, upset about my sin, wondering how I could ever be right with God. My friend said this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            You want to be a surface-level sinner so you can have, in Christ, a surface-level savior. Forget that. You now must accept that Christ is a real Savior and you are a real sinner. God wasn't joking or pretending; He was dead serious when he sent His own Son into the world and had Him killed in our place.
